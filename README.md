Hello, My name is Michael. I am the owner of Mike's Delivery and Business LLC. "www.mikesdeliverybusiness.com" which is a Logistics and Solutions business with a Delivery App, load Board, Marketplace (Mike's Marketplace)"www.mikesdeliveryservices.com", And Design Agency (Mike's Design Agency)"www.mikesdesignagency.com". I am currently learning how to code from Code Kentucky so that I may better understand how to help my customers and develop my own business without having to pay someone else to do it all.
